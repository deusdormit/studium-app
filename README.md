<h1 align="center">⏲️ Studium - Study Tracker</h1>
Studium is a simple, distraction-free productivity app to help you track your study sessions and meet your goals built in React Native. I built this for an introductory React & React Native university class.

<br>📌 This app connects to a MySQL database. You can find the SQL schema used to create the required tables in the [Studium API repo](https://github.com/yourusername/studium-api).
